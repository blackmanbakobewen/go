go
==

What is this?
-------------

The go command can help manage remote servers SSH access in same way, and do not need to remember so many accounts for those servers.

OS requirements
---------------

The command tested on MacOSX, but should be working on most linux distributions. It depends on expect on your local system, and the remote servers need to enable SSH.

If you feels something wrong, please file a issue on this project, because I do not test the scripts on every case, but I am happy to help you out.

Usage
-----

1. git clone
```
To be continued!
```
